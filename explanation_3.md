### Rearrange Array Elements

To generate two numbers from provided list of integer that forms max sum, 
is possible to sort them and then build two numbers iterating on sorted list 
owen element of it will form one number and odd another.  

### Time and Space complexity

Space complexity: 0(n) because merge sort copy elements while sorting.
Time complexity: O(n log n) due using merge sort to sort elements.
