### Dutch National Flag Problem

0 should be in start, 1 should be in middle, 2 should be at the end.

Iterate one by one element and put it to right place. Focus on 0 and 2. 
1 will be ordered automatically.

### Time and Space complexity

Space complexity: O(n) Need to keep all elements in memory.
Time complexity: O(n) due to single traversal.
