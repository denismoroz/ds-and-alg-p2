### Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

Iterate over the list and compare each element with memorized previous min and max value.

### Time and Space complexity

Space complexity: O(1) only two extra variables should be allocated to store min and max value.
Time complexity: O(n) - there is a need to iterate over each element in a list once.
